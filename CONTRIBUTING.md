More examples - https://github.com/users/nicitaacom/projects/5/views/1?sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=59471618&pane=issue

1. Start with **add** if you need to add smth and **imp** if you need to improve and **fix** if you need to fix smth
2. Add 3-4 _snake_case_ worlds what do you want to add
   Basicaly on:
   firstWorld you write logic that object should do e.g close

   secondWorld you write where it should be e.g authModal

   thirdWorld you write object that do something e.g button

   fourthWorld you write condition e.g onCloseOutside

3. Just check more examples - to get understanding (because for example not always you should write)
   in which file you need imp or fix smth because it may obvioulsy

### Commit naming

## Folder structure

### Imports

![imports structure](https://i.imgur.com/1LEoZ8K.png)

### How to undertand what's going on

In each folder I have `dev_readme.md` file - so you can understnad what's going on in each folder of my project
Note: You don't need to read all `dev_readme.md` files - do it if needed
I mean if it not related to your task you may don't read about it

## Write your own docs

Wirte docs in style
`What problem if solves`
Your docs how to use something

For example:
This file needed to format price from `199999.99` to this `$1,999,99.99`
or
I use this component to show how much products will be shown per page
I added this component because some users may be annoyed with clicking '>' button
